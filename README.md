Follow along with video by [developedbyed](https://www.youtube.com/@developedbyed)'s video [Three.js Crash Course For Beginners | Create This Awesome 3D Website!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OwJV2xL8M8). Originally written in vanilla Three.js but I created it with React Three Fiber.

## Running the project
